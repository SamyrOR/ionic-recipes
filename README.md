## 💡 How it works

### Pre-requisites

Ensure you have npm installed to run `npm install` after cloning the project

#### Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
```

```bash
Run `ionic capacitor add android` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
```

#### Build for IOS

```bash
Run `ionic capacitor add ios` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
```

```bash
